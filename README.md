## Summary

This set of smart contracts enables decentralized payments.

The main purpose of this smart contract evolves around the `pay` function,
which allows a sender to pay a receiver while swapping tokens as part of the same transaction if required.

This enables ETH to ETH, tokenA to tokenA, ETH to tokenA, tokenA to ETH and tokenA to tokenB payments.

To increase functionalities and to enable more and future decentralized exchanges and protocols,
additional plugins can be added/approved by calling `approvePlugin`.

## Functionalities

### `pay` Sender pays a receiver

The main function to peform payments.

Arguments:

`path`: The path of the token conversion:

```
ETH to ETH payment: 
['0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE']

DEPAY to DEPAY payment: 
['0xa0bEd124a09ac2Bd941b10349d8d224fe3c955eb']

ETH to DEPAY payment: 
['0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE', '0xa0bEd124a09ac2Bd941b10349d8d224fe3c955eb']

DEPAY to ETH payment: 
['0xa0bEd124a09ac2Bd941b10349d8d224fe3c955eb', '0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE']

DEPAY to UNI payment (routing goes through WETH): 
['0xa0bEd124a09ac2Bd941b10349d8d224fe3c955eb', '0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2', '0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984']
```

`amounts`: Amounts passed to proccessors:

```
e.g. [amountIn, amountOut, deadline]
```

`addresses`: Addresses passed to proccessors:

```
e.g. [receiver]
or [for, smartContractReceiver]
```

`plugins`: List of plugins to be executed in the given order for this payment:

```
e.g. [uniswap,payment] to swap and pay
or [uniswap,contractCall] to swap and call another contract
```
See [Approved Plugins](#approved-plugins) for more details about available and approved plugins.

`data`: Additional data passed to the payment plugins (e.g. contract call signatures):

```
e.g. ["signatureOfSmartContractFunction(address,uint)"] receiving the payment
```

### `approvePlugin` Approves a payment plugin.

`plugin`: Address for the plugin to be approved.


## Approved Plugins

### DePayPaymentsV1

Used to send tokens (or ETH) to a receiver.

Sends the token of path at the last position (`path[path.length-1]`) for the amount at index 1 (`amounts[1]`) to the address at the last position (`addresses[addresses.length-1]`).

### DePayPaymentsV1Uniswap01

Swap tokenA to tokenB, ETH to tokenA or tokenA to ETH on Uniswap as part of the payment.

Swaps tokens according to provided `path` using the amount at index 0 (`amounts[0]`) as input amount,
the amount at index 1 (`amounts[1]`) as output amount and the amount at index 2 (`amount[2]`) as deadline.

### DePayPaymentsV1ApproveAndCallContractAddressAmount01

Call another smart contract to deposit an amount for a given address while making sure the amount passed to the contract is approved.

Approves the amount at index 1 of `amounts` (`amounts[1]`)
for the token at the last position of `path` (`path[path.length-1]`)
to be used by the smart contract at index 1 of `addresses` (`addresses[1]`).

Afterwards, calls the smart contract at index 1 of `addresses` (`addresses[1]`),
passing the address at index 0 of `addresses` (`addresses[0]`)
and passing the amount at index 1 of `amounts` (`amounts[1]`)
to the method with the signature provided in `data` at index 0 (`data[0]`).

## Examples

### tokenA to tokenB payment with smart contract receiver (e.g. staking pool)

https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0x7239410d735016e84fc1cc59542e3a6af00c78d1817e6d60ef3bddc475fc734b

`path` needs to go through tokenA -> WETH -> tokenB if executed by Uniswap.

Requires to approve token at first index of path to be approved for the payment protocol smart contract.

Get amounts through the Uniswap router by passing the same `path` and the desired output amount to receive the required input amount.
