## Summary

This smart contract enables decentralized payment processing.

The main purpose of this smart contract evolves around the `pay` function,
which allows a sender to pay a receiver while swapping tokens as part of the same transaction if required.

This enables ETH to ETH, tokenA to tokenA, ETH to tokenA, tokenA to ETH and tokenA to tokenB payments.

To increase functionalities and to enable more and future decentralized exchanges and protocols,
additional processors can be added/approved by calling `approveProcessor`.

## Functionalities

### `pay` Sender pays a receiver

The main function to process payments.

Arguments:

`path`: The path of the token conversion:

```
ETH to ETH payment: 
['0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000']

DEPAY to DEPAY payment: 
['0xa0bEd124a09ac2Bd941b10349d8d224fe3c955eb']

ETH to DEPAY payment: 
['0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000', '0xa0bEd124a09ac2Bd941b10349d8d224fe3c955eb']

DEPAY to ETH payment: 
['0xa0bEd124a09ac2Bd941b10349d8d224fe3c955eb', '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000']

DEPAY to UNI payment (processing goes through WETH): 
['0xa0bEd124a09ac2Bd941b10349d8d224fe3c955eb', '0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2', '0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984']
```

`amounts`: Amounts passed to proccessors:

```
e.g. [amountIn, amountOut, deadline]
```

`addresses`: Addresses passed to proccessors:

```
e.g. [receiver]
or [for, smartContractReceiver]
```

`processors`: List and order of processors to be executed for this payment:

```
e.g. [uniswapProcessor,paymentProcessor] to swap and pay
or [uniswapProcessor,callContractProcessor] to swap and call another contract
```
See [Approved Processors](#approved-processors) for more details about available and approved processors.

`data`: List and order of processors to be executed for this payment:

```
e.g. ["signatureOfSmartContractFunction(address,uint)"] receiving the payment
```

### `approveProcessor` Approves a payment processor.

`processor`: Address for the processor to be approved.


## Approved Processors

### DePayPaymentProcessorV1

Used to send tokens (or ETH) to a receiver.

Sends the token of path at the last position (`path[path.length-1]`) for the amount at index 1 (`amounts[1]`) to the address at the last position (`addresses[addresses.length-1]`).

Mainnet: 

Ropsten: [0xcd1A015321B183cB5Ea046a4C80dd6E88B89F3b5](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xcd1a015321b183cb5ea046a4c80dd6e88b89f3b5)

### DePayPaymentProcessorV1Uniswap01

Swap tokenA<>tokenB, ETH<>tokenA or tokenA<>ETH on Uniswap as part of the payment.

Swaps tokens according to provided `path` using the amount at index 0 (`amounts[0]`) as input amount,
the amount at index 1 (`amounts[1]`) as output amount and the amount at index 2 (`amount[2]`) as deadline.

Mainnet: 

Ropsten: [0x80F43d58E068e04125B9688EE46821A42CD4c53E](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x80f43d58e068e04125b9688ee46821a42cd4c53e)

### DePayPaymentProcessorV1ApproveAndCallContractAddressAmount01

Call another smart contract to deposit an amount for a given address while making sure the amount passed to the contract is approved.

Approves the amount at index 1 of `amounts` (`amounts[1]`)
for the token at the last position of `path` (`path[path.length-1]`)
to be used by the smart contract at index 1 of `addresses` (`addresses[1]`).

Afterwards, calls the smart contract at index 1 of `addresses` (`addresses[1]`),
passing the address at index 0 of `addresses` (`addresses[0]`)
and passing the amount at index 1 of `amounts` (`amounts[1]`)
to the method with the signature provided in `data` at index 0 (`data[0]`).

## Examples

### tokenA to tokenB payment with smart contract receiver (e.g. staking pool)

https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0xd284b953e2d2828c30aabf31e7399a3329a4b1be29e5b55470bf454345f22910

`path` needs to go through tokenA -> WETH -> tokenB if processed by Uniswap.

Requires to approve token at first index of path to be approved on Uniswap router for the payment processor smart contract.

Get amounts through the Uniswap router by passing the same `path` and the desired output amount to receive the required input amount.
